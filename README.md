# Data Mining Clustering Project

In this research, our objective was to categorize credit card customers by examining a range of details pertaining to their expenditure patterns and credit information. The chosen problem presents an intriguing opportunity, as it provides valuable insights into the identification of customer groups characterized by comparable financial conditions and spending behaviors; subsequent clustering enables organizations to discern clusters at heightened risk of credit default, thereby empowering them to proactively mitigate potential losses through targeted credit restrictions for clusters harboring customers with a history of defaults. In this paper, three different clustering algorithms were implemented to cluster customers based on the credit cards dataset. The algorithms were then compared based on their scores in terms of clustering performance metrics like silhouette coefficient. The outcome that we observed was DBSCAN was performing the best as per silhouette coefficient, and K-Means was performing the best as per Calinskiâ€“Harabasz index and Davies-Bouldin index.
